# CDTool

CDTool is in-development a tool meant to test grammar constriants of different constrained-decoding libraries. Current plans for the tool are that user can choose a local model, constrained-decoding library, and grammar, and generate output of that grammar with insight into logit probabilites and parsing tree.
